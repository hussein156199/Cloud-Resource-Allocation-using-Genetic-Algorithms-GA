1.Introduction and Overview 
1.1 Project Idea 
The project focuses on developing an intelligent system for Cloud Resource 
Allocation using Genetic Algorithms (GA). 
Cloud computing has revolutionized the way computing resources are accessed, 
managed, and delivered. Among the three service models (IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS). 
Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) stands out for offering flexible, scalable, and 
on-demand access to computing infrastructure such as virtual machines. With 
the rapid growth of cloud computing, efficiently distributing computational tasks 
across virtual machines (VMs) and physical servers has become a critical 
challenge. The main goal of this project is to minimize the total execution time 
(Make span), reduce operational costs, and avoid resource violations, while 
ensuring balanced load distribution among available resources. 
The system simulates a cloud environment with multiple servers, each hosting a 
set of virtual machines, and a queue of incoming computational tasks. Using a 
Genetic Algorithm, the system searches for optimal or near-optimal allocations 
of tasks to VMs, considering constraints such as CPU, RAM, storage capacity, 
and task priorities. 
This project serves as a practical application of AI-driven optimization for 
demonstrating how heuristic algorithms like GA can significantly improve 
performance, cost-efficiency, and reliability in dynamic cloud environments. 
The system includes: 
• Servers 
• Virtual Machines (VMs) 
• Tasks 
key Objectives: 
1. Efficient allocation of tasks to virtual machines and servers. 
2. Minimization of total execution time (Make span). 
3. Reduction of operational costs. 
4. Maintenance of balanced load across resources. 
5. Simulation-based evaluation to test the effectiveness of GA in cloud 
scheduling.
